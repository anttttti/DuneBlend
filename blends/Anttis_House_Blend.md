# Anttis_House_Blend

## Overview

### Description

A Dune Imperium house blend of Imperium, Uprising, Bloodlines and Rise of Ix, for advanced players. The aim is a curated and balanced mix of the four sets, enabling a greater diversity of strategies and balanced gameplay.

Goals:
1. Increase variety compared to Uprising, with half of the game elements coming from the other sets.
2. Use all of the game mechanics from the four sets.
3. Balance the blend to have similar cost, access and affiliation distributions as the original game.
4. Balance the game mechanics so that a variety of strategies are viable.
5. Use as many of the game elements from the non-Uprising sets as possible, while maintaining balance

A couple of novelties in this blend compared to earlier ones:
1. This is an advanced version of "Antti's Basic House Blend". Depending on the player group experience and preference, this blend can be played by adding the additional game pieces on the spot. For a fast game setup, the additional cards, tiles and boards can be stored separately in the Rise of Ix or Bloodlines box. This way you can play these blends with any mix of experience levels at your board game event.
2. The blend has been done with a new app, which enables individual selection game pieces and checking the resulting statistics.

### Leader Selection
