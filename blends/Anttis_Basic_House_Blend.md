# Anttis_Basic_House_Blend

## Overview

### Description

An introductory Dune Imperium house blend of Imperium, Uprising, Bloodlines and Rise of Ix. The aim is to introduce new players to the game, with enough variety to interest experienced Dune players. This is similar to "Merakon's House Blend", but adds Bloodlines, and balances the blend further.

Goals:
1. Increase variety compared to Uprising, with half of the game elements coming from the other sets.
2. Use only game mechanics from Uprising
3. Balance the blend to have similar cost, access and affiliation distributions as the original game.
4. Balance the game mechanics so that a variety of strategies are viable.

A couple of novelties in this blend compared to earlier ones:
1. This is a simplified version of "Antti's House Blend". Depending on the player group experience and preference, this blend can be played by adding the additional game pieces on the spot. For a fast game setup, the additional cards, tiles and boards can be stored separately in the Rise of Ix or Bloodlines box. This way, you can play these blends with different experience levels
2. The blend has been done with a new app, which enables individual selection of all game piece types, and checking that the resulting statistics are balanced

### Leader Selection
